# Individual-Level Factors Affecting the Residents’ Feeling of the Degree of Social Justice
## Evidence from Chinese Survey Data
# Abstract

I pay attention to the citizens’ feeling about whether this society is justice in China, which is influenced by individual and regional features. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively study and identify the potential factors have impacts on social justice. **PCA** is used to draw information of the individual attributes and perform data reduction. Then we adopt **ordered probit model** to analyze the effect of extracted principal components on peoples’ feeling about the degree of social justice. We find that both better living environment and health status have positive effects on residents’ feeling about the level of society justice. And people’s attitudes toward politics can indicate their feelings of social justice. Finally, increment of the social status and optimistic expectation for the future social status indicate better feeling of the degree of social justice.
